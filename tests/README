This is a minimal testsuite for fontforge. I expect it will grow with time.

You can execute the tests with 'make check' on top level directory or in
this testsuite directory.

Some need extra fonts not bundled with FontForge. Some can be
downloaded automatically; others are not readily available, and are
documented below. If you have them, place them inside the fonts/
folder in order to enable the extra tests; otherwise they will be
skipped.

test001.pe, test1001a.py, test1001b.py
  Zapfino-4.0d3.dfont
  Zapfino-4.1d6.dfont

test002.pe
  HanSans-Bold.otf	(any other cid-keyed otf file would do)

test010.pe
  GillSans.dfont

test112.pe, test113.pe
  CourierNew.ttf

test116.pe
  merged.cff

test123.pe, test125.pe  (available from Adobe Acrobat Reader)
  MinionPro-Regular.otf

test0101.py             (available from Mac OS X?)

  nuvo-medium-woff-demo.woff

================================================================================

This directory also includes the file randomtest.c . This program takes a
directory of good fonts, makes copies of them, introduces random errors into
those copies, and runs fontforge on the result. If ff crashes it saves the
test, otherwise it deletes it. Then it tries another test.
